# IT HelpDesk System
The main project's goal is to create a simple IT Helpdesk System for small offices.

The system should help the IT department and users to communicate with each other: 
- receive information about user's issues 
- create tickets 
- route tickets according to the established process 
- provide information about current tickets' status

*More details about the project will be added soon...*

**This is the [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/) Bootcamp capstone project.**
